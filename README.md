# Blazor-CRUD-With-MongoDB
In this article we will create a Blazor application using MongoDB as our database provider. We will create a Single Page Application (SPA) and perform CRUD operations on it. A modal popup will display the form to handle the user inputs and the form also has a dropdown list, which will bind to a DB collection.

We will use Visual Studio 2017 and MongoDB 4.0.

Take a look at the final application.
