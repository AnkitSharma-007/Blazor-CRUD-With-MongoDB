# Blazor-CRUD-With-MongoDB
We will create a Blazor application using MongoDB as our database provider. We will create a Single Page Application (SPA) and perform CRUD operations on it. We will use a form to accept the user inputs. The form will have client-side validations and contains a dropdown list, which will bind to a collection in our database. We will also provide a filter option to the user to filter the employee records based on employee name.

We will use Visual Studio 2019 and MongoDB 4.2.
